    <p><em>The Lost Tapes</em> is a collection of eight never-before-released songs by Go Pound Salt.  These songs were recorded in 1997, stuck in a box and forgotten about, until 20 years later in 2017.  The audio was rescued using modern technology with and enhanced with new guitar and vocal tracks.</p>
    <p><em>The Lost Tapes</em> documents Go Pound Salt at a creative-high, an eclective mix of pop punk, math rock and cow punk.</p>
